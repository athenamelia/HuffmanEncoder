# HuffmanEncoder

Amelia Tran @ Summer 2019

- Implement the Huffman encoding of English characters, using priority queue and hashmap.
- The program will read and compress an input text file inputFileName, based on the Huffman encoding produced using the
input text file encodingFileName, and output the compressed file in outputFileName. The method will output the outcome of its execution. The output file contains the characters “0” and “1”.
